/**
 * Each Python {@code type} object is implemented by an <i>instance</i>
 * in Java of {@code PyType}. As {@code PyType} is {@code abstract},
 * that means each is an instance of a subclass of {@code PyType}. Only
 * {@code PyType} is public API. The built-ins {@code object},
 * {@code type}, {@code str}, {@code int}, etc. and any class defined in
 * Python, are instances in Java of a subclass of {@code PyType}.
 * <p>
 * A particular Java subclass of {@code PyType}, implementing
 * {@link ExtensionPoint}, is used to represent those types that are
 * instances of Python subclasses of {@code type} (known as
 * <i>metaclasses</i>). Given the program text: <pre>
 * class Meta(type): pass
 * class MyClass(metaclass=Meta): pass
 * mc = MyClass()
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The following will be the implementation types of the objects
 * defined:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code Meta} will be an instance in Java of
 * {@link ReplaceableType}, a subclass of {@code PyType} that is not an
 * extension point class.</li>
 * <li>{@code MyClass} will be an instance in Java of
 * {@link AbstractPyType.Derived}, a subclass of {@code PyType}
 * implementing {@link ExtensionPoint}.</li>
 * <li>{@code mc} will be an instance in Java of
 * {@link AbstractPyBaseObject}, a subclass of {@code Object}
 * implementing {@link ExtensionPoint}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * {@code PyType} also offers type object lookup and creation methods,
 * for example {@link PyType#fromSpec(TypeSpec)}. For this purpose it
 * holds the single static instance of the Python type factory, which
 * comes into being upon first use of the {@code PyType} class.
