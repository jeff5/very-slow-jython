 * A specification for a Python type that acts as a complex argument to

 * definition of a Python object creates one of these data structures
 * during static initialisation, configuring it using the mutators. A
 * fluent interface makes this configuration readable as a single long
 * statement. The normal idiom is:<pre>
 * public static PyType TYPE = PyType.fromSpec(
 *    new TypeSpec("Example", MethodHandles.lookup()));
 * </pre> The Python name of the class being specified may begin with
 * the dotted (Python) package name.
 * <p>
 * Recall that {@code MethodHandles.lookup} is context sensitive: it
 * captures the identity of the class from which it was called, in the
 * {@code Lookup} it returns. In the example, this class becomes the
 * (primary) Java representation class for instances of the type, and
 * the source of fields and method definitions. It is possible to adjust
 * this behaviour though choice of constructor and mutators on the
