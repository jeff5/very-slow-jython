     * <p>
     * Types may ignore this technique if the designer is content with a
     * {@code __rsub__(MyObject, Object)} that coerces its right-hand
     * argument on each call. (This method has to exist to satisfy the
     * Python data model.) The method may be defined in the
     * {@link #canonical(Class) canonical} class, or
     * {@link #methodImpls(Class...) methodImpls}.
     * <p>
     * A separate class is necessary since the method definition for
     * {@code __rsub__(MyObject, Object)} must sometimes return
     * {@code Py.NotImplemented}, and we should like to avoid checking
     * for that in the call site. Rather, the absence of a definition
     * should indicate that the operation is not defined for a given
     * pair of types Certain built-ins use the technique to speed up
     * call sites in JVM byte code compiled from Python. (The class may
     * be generated by a script.)
