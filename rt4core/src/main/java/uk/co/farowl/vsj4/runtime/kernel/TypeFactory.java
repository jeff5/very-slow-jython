/**
 * The {@code TypeFactory} is the home of Python type creation and
 * management. In normal operation, only one instance of
 * {@code TypeFactory} will be created. It will be held statically by
 * the {@link PyType} class. Exceptionally, we create and destroy
 * instances for limited test purposes.
 * <p>
 * The {@code TypeFactory} is kept thread-safe, in a complex reentrant
 * process of type creation, by careful synchronisation that counts the
 * reentrant calls. When the factory creates type objects they go
 * through two stages: "Java ready" where they are internally consistent
 * from a Java perspective and "Python ready" when they have acquired
 * their full set of attributes.
 * <p>
 * The design ensures that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>All partially completed work in the factory belongs to the single
 * thread that has taken the object-level lock.</li>
 * <li>All work for the thread is completed by the time the thread
 * finally leaves the factory (when the lock is released).</li>
 * <li>All {@link Representation}s and types created for a thread are
 * published (or discarded in the event of an error) by the time the
 * thread finally leaves the factory.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Type objects may become visible to Java while only Java ready
 * (perhaps through static data in the defining class), and thus can be
 * seen without their Python attributes. The thread that creates these
 * type objects will always make them Python ready eventually, so the
 * caution is needed in that thread only when accessing intermediate
 * values returned in that process. The client (i.e. outside the type
 * system) that instigated type creation will always receive a Python
 * ready type.
 * <p>
 * Some other thread accessing a type as a static field may see it not
 * Python ready, while the thread that instigated type creation
 * completes it. Any thread obtaining a {@code Representation} from the
 * registry will block until its related type is Python ready.
 *
