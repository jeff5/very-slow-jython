/**
 * The Python {@code object} object: all Python objects by default
 * inherit its Python method implementations. The Python {@code object}
 * type is represented by {@code java.lang.Object} but it gets its
 * Python behaviour from methods defined here or in the superclass.
 * <p>
 * Although all Python objects are sub-classes in Python of
 * {@code object}, their Java representation classes will not generally
 * be sub-classes in Java of this one. In particular, many built-in
 * types are not.
 * <p>
 * The Java implementation class of a type defined in Python <i>will</i>
 * be derived from the canonical implementation class of the "solid
 * base" it inherits in Python. This <i>may</i> be {@code object}, in
 * which case the implementation class will be a sub-class in Java of
 * this class.
 *
 * @implNote All exposed methods, special methods and attribute get, set
 *     and delete methods defined here must be declared {@code static}
 *     in Java, with an explicit {@code Object self} argument.
 *     ({@code __new__} is excepted from this rule as it is
 *     {@code static} anyway.) This is so that methods defined here on
 *     {@code object} operate correctly on receiving Python objects
 *     whatever their Java class. Methods and fields must be package
 *     visible so that the type factory is able to form
 *     {@code MethodHandle}s to them using its default lookup object.
