/**
 * An interface that supports the implementation of {@code __new__}. The
 * implementing object must be a Python type object supplied by the run
 * time system.
 * <p>
 * A custom {@code __new__} method in the defining Java class of a type
 * generally has direct access to all the constructors it needs to
 * create instances of its own Python type (base constructors). However,
 * when asked for an instance of a different type, it must be able to
 * call the constructor of the Java class that represents instances of
 * that type.
 * <p>
 * Every Python type must therefore be able to supply a Java constructor
 * of its instances, and conversely its representation class must have a
 * constructor with a signature matching its Python base. Python classes
 * defined in Python are given a representation that satisfies this
 * criterion automatically.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides a way of looking up that matching
 * constructor, which we return as a {@code MethodHandle}.
