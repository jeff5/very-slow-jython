 * {@code ExtensionPoint} is an interface that identifies an object as

 * the implementation of Python types that allow
 * assignment to {@code __class__}.
 * <p>
 * Given a built-in Python class with Java implementation {@code A}, the
 * normal idiom is to define a nested subclass {@code A.Derived},
 * implementing this interface. At the Java level, all such classes
 * provide an instance dictionary and array of slot variables (named by
 * {@code __slots__} in the type). The type object determines which of
 * these (dictionary, slots or both) is actually present.
