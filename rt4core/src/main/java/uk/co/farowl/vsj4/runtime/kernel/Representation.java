/**
 * A {@code Representation} provides Python behaviour to a Java object
 * by linking its Java class to essential type information. Every Java
 * class has a {@code Representation} that may be found from the type
 * system, even if it must be created to satisfy the enquiry. Java
 * classes may share a representation if they are all subclasses of the
 * same base in Java.
 * <p>
 * In many cases, the Java class alone determines the {@link PyType
 * Python type} and behaviour. In cases where instances of the Java
 * class can represent objects with different (or mutable) Python type,
 * the object itself identifies the actual type by implementing
 * {@link WithClass}.
 * <p>
 * The run-time system will form a mapping from each Java class to an
 * instance of (a specific sub-class of) {@code Representation}. Apart
 * from a small collection of bootstrap classes (all of them built-in
 * types), this mapping will be developed as instances of the classes
 * are encountered in Python code.
